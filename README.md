# Contributor License Agreement

If you contribute to one of the following projects, you may need to sign a CLA:
- [revoltchat/backend](https://gitub.com/revoltchat/backend)

You can view the [individual CLA here](CLA.md).

## How to sign

Once you create a pull request and have not previously signed:
- A bot (["CLA Assistant Lite"](https://github.com/contributor-assistant/github-action)) will reply to you asking for you to confirm that you've read and agree to the CLA.
- You reply to the bot with your confirmation.
- Your PR can be accepted.

You only need to sign the CLA once to be able to contribute to any Revolt project.

## Why?

Having a CLA in place allows us to:
- Ensure all contributions are licensed under the project's respective license.
- Be able to enforce any given project's license.
- Keep the door open to provide commercial offerings in the future, i.e. use of Revolt in corporate environments.
- (may be required to) implement tailored anti-spam solutions for the main platform, i.e. custom captcha software.

## Feedback appreciated

If you have any complaints, suggestions or anything else you'd like to discuss about this, please get in touch so we can help improve the process / project. You can either open an issue on this repository or email contact@revolt.chat.
